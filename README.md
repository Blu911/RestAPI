# Workshop 5 Rest API in Java
* The aim of the workshop is to write backend functionality for cataloging books using the REST method.
* To create the API, I use Spring MVC, an additional Jackson library, Lombok library and additional annotations.
* The correctness of the API is checked by using the Workshop 4 and Postman.
